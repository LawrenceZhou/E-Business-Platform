# E-Business-Platform
This school course-based project aimed to build an E-Business Platform, which al- lowed users to buy and pay using the platform and administrators to manage com- modities.
They simulate the online shopping process, as BankPortal simulating the process of withdrawing and depositing and paying the online order, ECommercePlatform simulating the process of surfing on an online store and making an order. The last part of project is that I use Socket to connect two sub-projects, to make it seem like real-life online shopping.
